            <h2>Team History</h2>
            <p>The Michigan men's lacrosse team is one of the oldest collegiate lacrosse programs in the Midwest, having been founded in 1940. The program competed for a few years, then stopped due to World War II, and then restarted again in 1965 and has been playing ever since.
            In 2001, Michigan was elevated to club-varsity status, competing at the Division 1 level of the Men's Collegiate Lacrosse Association. In 2008, Michigan became the first MCLA to finish a season undefeated, 20-0, and won their first national championship. The feat was repeated in 2009
            with another 20-0 season and national championship. In 2010, they won their third national championship. The success of the Michigan Men's lacrosse team led to their promotion to NCAA Division 1 status in the 2012 season. Michigan's Division 1 team now plays in the Big Ten along side
            some of the best lacrosse programs in the country like Johns Hopkins, Rutgers, Maryland, Penn State, and Ohio State. Club Lacrosse now acts as a "reserve team" for the varsity team, as well as a student organization that plays lacrosse for fun!

            <h2>Lacrosse in Michigan</h2>
            <p>The sport of lacrosse is deeply rooted in the history of the state of Michigan. 1763 is the year that lacrosse became Michigan’s liberator and first team sport. In the summer of 1763 the Sauk and Ojibwe needed a plan to recapture Fort Michilimackinac (upper Michigan) from the British. 
            The British were at war with the French and controlled all the trading in the Upper-Midwest. Since the Ojibwe and Sauk preferred the French’s favorable trading practices over those of the English they devised a unique plan, 
            using a lacrosse game to distract the British soldiers so they could take over the fort. The date for the game was set for June 2 to coincide with the English Kings birthday when the soldiers would be free from their duties and 
            ready to be entertained by the public wagering on the game. On the day of the game the plan had the women of both tribes line up along the wall in front of the main gate with tomahawks, knives and war clubs under their shawls and blankets. 
            As the game moved closer to the main gate the ball was thrown into the Fort. The players from both teams dropped their sticks, grabbing the weapons from the women and stormed the unsuspecting British through the open main gate capturing the Fort and all the goods, 
            and that’s how Lacrosse liberated Michigan for the natives! (source: <a href="https://www.1763lacrosse.com/">1763 Lacrosse</a>)</p>
