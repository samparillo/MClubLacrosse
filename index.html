        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We are the Men's Reserve Lacrosse Club at the University of Michigan, the reigning NCLL Midwest Champions.
        We play both a fall and spring season and are routinely competitive at a national level. While our team does
        aim to win our conference, make the playoffs, and contend for a national title each year, Michigan Club Lacrosse
        is open to all and there are no cuts. Our team is about having fun, getting active, and being a part of a community
        of students who love the sport of lacrosse. Along with weekly practices and games, Club Lacrosse also participates
        in philanthropy and social events around campus. We are a great way to make friends and find your place at the University
        of Michigan.
